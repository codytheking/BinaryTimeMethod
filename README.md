# BinaryTimeMethod

The data file (data.txt) has five clock “faces”, each separated by a blank line. The columns contain some combination of zeros and asterisks (the asterisks are like the ones in a binary number). The program reads the faces and prints out the appropriate times. The times are printed in a HH:MM:SS format, with a leading zero for each field if necessary.
